            SCENE I (Monsieur Jourdain, Music Master, Dancing Master, Lackeys)

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: That's not all that bad, and those people there
hop around well.

MUSIC MASTER: When the dance is combined with the music, it will
have even better effect, and you will see something quite good in
the little ballet we have prepared for you.

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: That's for later, when the person I ordered all
this for is to do me the honor of coming here to dine.

DANCING MASTER: Everything is ready.

MUSIC MASTER: However, sir, this is not enough. A person like you,
who lives magnificently, and who are inclined towards fine things,
should have a concert of music here every Wednesday or every
Thursday.

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Is that what people of quality do?

MUSIC MASTER: Yes, Sir.

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: Then I'll have them. Will it be fine?

MUSIC MASTER: Without doubt. You must have three voices--a tenor,
a soprano, and a bass, who will be accompanied by a bass-viol, a
theorbo, and a clavecin for the chords, with two violins to play
the ritournelles.

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: You must also add a trumpet marine. The trumpet
marine is an instrument that pleases me and it's harmonious.

MUSIC MASTER: Leave it to us to manage things.

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: At least, don't forget to send the musicians to
sing at table.

MUSIC MASTER: You will have everything you should have.

MONSIEUR JOURDAIN: But above all, let the ballet be fine.
