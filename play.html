   <p> SCENE I (Monsieur Jourdain, Music Master, Dancing Master, Lackeys)</p>

    <h6 class="name monsieur-jourrdain">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6>
    <p class="speech">That's not all that bad, and those people there
    hop around well.</p>

    <h6 class="name monsieur-jourrdain">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6>
    <P class="speech"> How was that?</P>
    <P class="direction"> (Breathlessly)</P>
    
    <h6 class="name music-master">MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
    <p class="speech"> When the dance is combined with the music, it will
    have even better effect, and you will see something quite good in
    the little ballet we have prepared for you.</p>
    
    <h6 class="name monsieur-jourrdain">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6>
    <p class="speech"> That's for later, when the person I ordered all
    this for is to do me the honor of coming here to dine.</p>
    
    <h6 class="name dancing-master">DANCING MASTER:</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Everything is ready.</p>
    
    <h6 class="name music-master">MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
    <p class="speech"> However, sir, this is not enough. A person like you,
    who lives magnificently, and who are inclined towards fine things,
    should have a concert of music here every Wednesday or every
    Thursday.</p>
    
    <h6 class="name monsieur-jourrdain">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Is that what people of quality do?</p>
    
    <h6 class="name music-master">MUSIC MASTER:</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Yes, Sir.</p>
    
    <h6 class="name monsieur-jourrdain">MONSIEUR JOURDAIN:</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Then I'll have them. Will it be fine?</p>
    
    <h6 class="name dancing-master">DANCING MASTER:</h6>
    <p class="speech"> Everything is ready.</p>
